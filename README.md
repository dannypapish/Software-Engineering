# Software-Engineering
This is a collection of modules containing lab exercises for a "Software Engineering" class I took in college. The code is done mainly in Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  

**M2** - two parts: "calculator" - a calculator app that performs simple and scientific opetations. "polygons" - an interactive game where the user uses the keyboard arrows to reshape the shapes on the screen. Directions for running the app: in the terminal, navigate to the "calculator" folder and run "python gui.py" or "python3 gui.py." then navigate to the "polygons" folder and run "python pygameGUI.py" or "pyhon3 pygameGUI.py", depending on the version on your machine. The oop folder contains a simple object oriented programming exercise.  

**M3** - Demonstrates code testing by printing testing reports for a prototype of an app that is generating business invoices. to run the program: in terminal navigate to the folder and run "python tests.py", "invoiceTests.py", "itemTests.py". (or python3, depending on your python version). The output will be text files with information about passed/failed tests, that will be generated under the "reports" folder.  

 **M4** - a simple app of creating a server and passing information using 'flask'. to run the app: in terminal, navigate to the main folder and first run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install 'flask 2.2.0' on your local machine. then navigate to "lab4" and run "python app.py" (or python3, depending on your python version). In addition, it includes a css exercise of bouncing shape. to access it, navigate to the "bounce" folder and click "index.html."  

**M5 & M6** - Exercices that are mainly focused on scraping data from the web. Running these apps requires a few dependencies and installing third-party apps such as "selenium", "postman", "docker" and "chromedriver". If you wish to run it, both modules have a "README.md" files with detailed instructions.  

*M6 includes few additional HTML/JavaScript/CSS apps - "prototype" - an app where an image can be manipulated by pressing different keyboard keys. It demonstrates how we can implement JavaScript to dynamically change the image's contrast, focus, zoom, color and more. To access it, navigate to the "prototype" folder and click on "index.html". "factory" where I demonstrate how data can be nicely organized in a table using JavaScript and CSS. To access it navigate to factory/index.html. The last app is "builder" which demonstrates a way to create a profile page using mainly JavaScript functions and a HTML page as a template. To access it navigate to builder/index.html.  

*All modules and subfolders have a seperate README.md files which include more detailed instructions and descriptions. In addition, the code includes detailed annotation.
